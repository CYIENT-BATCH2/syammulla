ALGORITHM:BITWISE OPERATOR
	1)User has to taken the inputs.
	2)We have to set a particular bit using bitwise OR 1<<pos and print it.
	3)We have to clear a particular bit using bitwise AND ,COMPLIMENT 1<<pos and print it.
	3)We have to compliment a bit using bitwise XOR 1<<pos and print it.
	4)if the num&(num-1) means print not a power of 2 ,else print power of 2.
